# ArtSpace
ArtSpace is an immersive app where users can browse art posted by other users and even preview on their walls. Independent artists can post their art and share it with the world. Users can view art and use an innovative augmented-reality feature to see how it would look in their home.

## User Stories
- Artiste: Independent artists can have trouble getting their work in front of potential appreciators. An artiste using ArtSpace can post images of their art to a central app where users have a chance to discover them and become fans.

- Art Appreciator: Art Appreciators can use this app to find high-quality art outside of what is availble through mass-market retailers or expensive galleries and art dealers. They can preview the art in their home.
